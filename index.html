                    <p>The most powerful and affecting trip I took was in fact a trip within a trip at the very scenic Canyonlands National Park - The Needles District</p>
                    <p>First, a bit of background on the park:  Canyonlands is a large National Park located near and around Moab, Utah, a thoroughly crunchy town with a huge outdoor recreation industry.  The contest for "Best Park in Utah" is a very tough field, and Zion National Park, Capitol Reef National Park, Arches National Park, and Bryce Canyon National Park are all located in Utah.  The Southern and Eastern stretches of the state are scenic just to drive through, but the unprecedented abundance of National Parks makes access and experiencing the grandure of the scrubby desert and its magical russet sandstone formations easier than in most other states.  For a state best known for Mormons, these cats can ball pretty hard for hippies and outdoors folk.</p>
                    <p>But I digress - the park.  Canyonlands is split into distinct districts: Island in the Sky is the northernmost, a series of plateaux and canyons woven around the Green River.  The Maze is to the west of Island in the Sky, highwalled and inacccessible by most vehicles.  Many reach this remote area by four-wheeler, horse, foot (tough going), or packraft down the Green River.</p>
                    <p>This particular adventure brought me to The Needles, the southernmost district with the most varied geography in the park (as far as I could tell).  After a brief but extremely helpful chat with a Ranger in their visitor center, I applied for a permit for a pittance of $20 and had two evenings at Devil's Pocket and Elephant Canyon 2 - small backpacker campsites in the northern Elephant Canyon section.</p>
