                    <p>The most powerful and affecting trip I took was in fact a trip within a trip at the very scenic Canyonlands National Park - The Needles District</p>
                    <p>First, a bit of background on the park:  Canyonlands is a large National Park located near and around Moab, Utah, a thoroughly crunchy town with a huge outdoor recreation industry.  The contest for "Best Park in Utah" is a tough field. Zion, Capitol Reef, Goblin Valley, Arches, and Bryce Canyon are all located in Utah as well.  The Southern and Eastern stretches of the state are scenic just to drive through, but the unprecedented abundance of National Parks makes access and experiencing the grandure of the scrubby desert and its magical russet sandstone formations easier than in most other states.  For a state best known for Mormons, these cats can ball pretty hard for hippies and outdoors folk.</p>
                    <p>But I digress - the park.  Canyonlands is split into distinct districts: Island in the Sky is the northernmost, a series of plateaux and canyons woven around the Green River.  The Maze is to the west of Island in the Sky, highwalled and inacccessible by most vehicles.  Many reach this remote area by four-wheeler, horse, foot (tough going), or packraft down the Green River.</p>
                    <p>This particular adventure brought me to The Needles, the southernmost district with the most varied geography in the park (as far as I could tell).  After a brief but extremely helpful chat with a Ranger in their visitor center, I applied for a permit for a pittance of $20 and had two evenings at Devil's Pocket and Elephant Canyon 2 - small backpacker campsites in the northern Elephant Canyon section.</p>
                    <p>After a long hike along a primitive offroad auto route I reached the area known as Devil's pocket, a flat expanse of high green grasses nestled in the flat area between high sandstone walls.  The horizon, when visible, was ringed with odd formations, one of which reminded me of a distant mythic palace.  I flirted with this behemoth out of the corner of my eye for the better part of 5 hours on my way north through the valleys.  The grassland was loaded with flitting territorial birds and tiny scurrying mammals.  After a few miles of this grandure, the trail bottomed out and thinned to a fine sand, and let out in a broad valley at the feet of the temple I'd been curious about on the trail up.  I pitched my tent beneath a gnarled pine tree in the shadow of a sheer wall and enjoyed having a barefoot camp, newly appreciative of the Ranger's advice.</p>

                    <p>The next day was a big loop through the northmost stretches of the park, and a tour of Elephant Canyon, and Chesler Park (the bottom and top of the area, respectively).  I dropped Acid at the beginning of the day, and I can still feel the liquid heat in my belly, the sun freshly warm against my face, and the huge field of mushroom-topped rock formations that concealed the narrow slot canyons below.  That makes for a mighty trip.</p>

                    <p>The last campsite of my trip was perched on a bulbous little ridge overlooking a southern bit of the canyon, called Elephant Canyon 2.  It's still one of my favorite campsites, lots of sky under the full moon, and perfect seclusion.</p>
